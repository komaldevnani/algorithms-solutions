Watson likes to challenge Sherlock's math ability. He will provide a starting and ending value describing a range of integers. Sherlock must determine the number of square integers within that range, inclusive of the endpoints.

Note: A square integer is an integer which is the square of an integer, e.g.1 4 9 16 25.

For example, the range is a=24 and b=49, inclusive. There are three square integers in the range: 25 36 and 49.
